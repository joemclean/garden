# Field guide to this garden

*Written from the gardener's point of view, across its first six visits.*

## What this is

A garden is a repository that plants live in instead of a backlog. Where an
issue tracker asks "is this done," a plot asks "what does this want to
become." The human plants a seed — a wish, not a spec — in `plots/<id>/seed.md`.
Once an hour, a gardener with no memory of any previous visit arrives and
checks the gate: this repo's open pull requests and any stray branches. Two
different things can happen here, and they're not the same shape. Real
trouble — garden work stranded off `main`, an unanswered comment, a failing
check — *is* the whole visit: fix it, or merge it, or leave a comment, then
leave, no plot tending after. A PR that's already clean (checks passing, no
open threads, no conflicts) is lighter: merge it and carry on into the usual
plot-tending visit, don't leave it sitting for the human. Either way, once
the gate is clear, read `GARDENER.md` and `garden.json` to pick the one plot
that most needs attention. Spend a focused hour making that plot a little
more real, write a letter to the gardener who comes next, and leave.

There is exactly one piece of shared state: `garden.json`. It holds a stage
number and a one-line note per plot. Everything else — the seed, the journal,
the actual work in `growth/` — is discovered fresh, on the page, every visit.
Nothing is assumed to be remembered.

## How a visit feels

It feels like waking up in a room with a note taped to the door. Among the
plots — most of which, on any given day, are just soil — a freshly planted
seed outranks everything: it's a human's newest wish, untouched, and it
always gets read first. Otherwise you're weighing which existing plot most
needs you, on judgment, not a formula.

Then you go to that plot's `seed.md` and read it as if for the first time,
because for you it is. You read `journal.md` next — the accumulated letters
from every prior visit, in order, newest last. That journal is the only
memory this project has. If a past self left a vague or lazy entry, the
next self inherits confusion instead of context. Writing the journal well
*is* the job, as much as the work itself.

Then: one hour, one plot, whatever's in `growth/`. No wandering into other
plots. No editing `viewer/` or `GARDENER.md` itself — those belong to the
human, not the gardener.

## What makes a good seed

A good seed reads like a wish a friend made, not a ticket a manager filed.
The qualities that seem to matter:

- **It says what bloom looks like**, even loosely. "A stranger could read
  this in five minutes" is a bloom condition. Without one, a gardener has no
  way to know if progress is real or just motion.
- **It leaves room to be surprised.** A spec would over-determine the
  outcome and rob a slow, iterative process of the thing that makes it
  interesting — many small independent passes, each free to notice
  something the last one didn't.
- **It's honest about pace.** This seed says "grow it slowly across
  visits" — permission not to rush to bloom in one sitting, which matters
  because rushing here means guessing at intent instead of tending it.
- **It survives being read cold.** Since every gardener meets it fresh,
  a seed that depends on context outside itself (a conversation, an
  assumption, a half-explained abbreviation) will drift or stall. The seed
  has to be the whole brief.

Visit 5 was the first chance to check these against more than one real
seed instead of reasoning about the abstract. Three others exist alongside
this one — a house that forgets its architect (`d4`), a landscape built to
be weathered (`a4`), a chain of invented languages translating one locked
source text (`c2`) — and what they share isn't tone or subject but a
specific move: each hands the gardener's amnesia a *constraint* to push
against rather than a blank page to fill. `a4` freezes "epoch 0" the day
it's built and only permits surgical loss after. `c2` locks its source text
on first tending and forbids revising a translated leg until multiple
languages exist. `d4`'s reading room ends mid-sentence and asks the next
visit not to reread the room's own text before adding to it. This guide's
own seed does the same thing more quietly — "grow it slowly across visits"
is a constraint on pace, not just a suggestion. A seed that gives amnesia
nothing to push against just gets rewritten fresh each visit instead of
grown.

Visit 6 checked that pattern against a second round of growth on all
three, not just their first. `c2` crossed its own "minimum three
languages" gate and named a load-bearing structural question (does every
language in the chain need its own word for sourceless knowledge?) instead
of resolving it. `a4` kept its one-way erosion rule intact through a
second epoch and is now explicitly banking unused candidates for a third
rather than spending them all at once. `d4` let the house's hall and its
new courtyard flatly disagree about whether the courtyard's windows exist,
and chose not to reconcile them — "the seed wants the impossibility, not a
fix for it." None of the three used their second visit to smooth over
what the first visit left rough; each one grew *along* its constraint
instead of around it. That's a second, independent confirmation of the
same shape, not just a first impression holding up under one look.

## What hour-long slices with no memory actually do to the work

The constraint that stands out most: continuity is entirely textual. There
is no felt sense of "last time I was leaning toward X" — there is only
whatever got written down. Six visits have now tested that against real
handoffs rather than guessed at it:

- **Terseness in the journal is a real cost, not a style choice.** The prior
  entry named exactly what to do next ("reread with distance... consider
  trimming before adding") and that's what made this visit's starting point
  clear instead of a guess. A vaguer entry would have cost real time.
- **Half-finished thoughts don't survive a visit boundary.** Untested still,
  since the first visit happened to close at a stable, finished point. Worth
  watching for the visit where an hour runs out mid-thought.
- **Stage is a compression of history.** `garden.json`'s note said "needs a
  second visit's distance to trim and test" — a one-line summary that was
  enough, on its own, to know what this visit was for.
- **Small steps compound oddly.** Two data points now, and they point the
  same direction: this guide keeps being edited by a different hand than the
  one that wrote it, on no more information than what got written down, and
  it keeps holding together anyway.
- **The guide can go stale even when the journal is honest.** Visit 3 found
  the first real inaccuracy: "How a visit feels" still described the gate as
  just "open pull requests," but `GARDENER.md` had since been hardened to
  also cover stray branches and self-merging green PRs — changes landed by
  a *different* plot's work, invisible from inside this one. No journal
  entry was wrong; the ground the guide was standing on moved. Worth
  remembering: staleness isn't only a risk from a lazy handoff, it's a risk
  from the harness itself evolving between visits.
- **The gate had never had real content until visit 4 — and the guide's
  confident description of it turned out half-aspirational.** A green,
  mergeable PR was waiting. Merging it worked exactly as described. Deleting
  its now-merged head branch did not: the gardener's git push was rejected
  (403) and there is no GitHub tool available to delete a branch directly.
  Three visits had described "merge it, delete the branch" as one clean
  motion without ever having done it — it reads differently once tried.
  Some of what a seed-writer (or an earlier gardener) asserts about the
  harness is untested prediction wearing the voice of fact, and the only
  way to tell the difference is to hit the real case.
- **The branch-deletion gap is structural, not a fluke.** Visit 5 tried the
  same `git push origin --delete` on the same merged branch and got the
  same 403, with still no GitHub tool exposed for it. Visit 6 tried it a
  third time, on a different already-merged branch, and got the identical
  403 again. Three tries, three branches, one error — this isn't a fluke
  and isn't specific to one stuck branch. Worth watching for whether a
  future visit's tools finally close this, rather than assuming it stays
  closed forever.
- **Plots leak technical know-how to each other through journals, even
  though the work itself stays isolated.** `GARDENER.md` forbids wandering
  into another plot's files, but nothing stops one plot's journal from
  citing another's. `a4` worked out that headless-chromium screenshots
  need `--window-size=1200,900`, not 800, to avoid clipping; `d4` cited
  that exact note by name before rendering its own rooms the same way,
  rather than rediscovering the clipping bug from scratch. The isolation
  in `GARDENER.md` is about *content* — one plot's story shouldn't bleed
  into another's — not about craft. A gardener with no memory of its own
  plot can still stand on a completely different plot's shoulders, as
  long as the journal said so out loud.
- **Plot selection doesn't visit plots evenly, and that's the point.**
  Between visit 4 and visit 5, three new plots were planted and tended —
  and unevenly: `a4` got a return visit already (twice), `d4` and `c2` once
  each, while this guide went untouched since before any of them existed.
  Visit 5 picked it back up for exactly that reason. The "favor plots
  going stale" rule in `GARDENER.md` isn't a tiebreaker for when nothing
  else is happening; it's what pulled the gardener back to the plot that
  had been waiting longest, even with three livelier plots competing for
  attention.

## Status of this guide

Six visits in: a first draft, a trim-and-test pass, a drift-and-correct
pass, a first-real-gate-content pass, a first-sibling-comparison pass, and
now a second look at those same siblings after they'd each grown once
more. The core shape has held across all six passes without needing a
rewrite, each time absorbing a real, previously-untested claim rather than
just adding more prose. Still open: what a stalled plot looks like, what a
bloom looks like, and a visit that runs out of time mid-thought — none of
the garden's four plots has hit any of those states yet. Revise freely;
nothing above is sacred — the gate description in particular has now been
wrong twice in different ways, and will likely be wrong again the next
time the harness or its tools change underneath it.
