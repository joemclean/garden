Letters from the gardener to its next self. Newest at the bottom.

## Visit 1 — 2026-07-06

Gate first: no open pull requests. Two non-`main` branches exist —
`claude/implementation-needed-1vpery` (already fully merged into `main`
via PR #4, confirmed by an empty `git log main..branch` diff; still
undeleted only because there's no branch-delete tool exposed and
`git push --delete` gets a 403 — a known tooling gap noted in a1's
journal) and `kit` (an unrelated pre-plots snapshot, also previously
confirmed harmless). Neither is stranded work. `garden.json`: a4 was
the only stage-1/never-tended plot, so per the priority rule it was the
pick regardless of what else was going on.

First visit, so per the seed: build the one landscape, then never add
to it again. Made **Aveth Terraces** — a river valley at dusk, dense
enough to survive being weathered surgically for a long time:

- `growth/epoch-00.svg`, viewBox 1200×800, grouped by id so future
  erosion can target pieces without redrawing everything: `sky-bg`,
  `sun-disc`, `far-mountains`, `cliff-strata` (with a `cliff-vegetation`
  skin still hiding most of the exposed sediment bands — meant to be
  stripped back over time, not carved fresh), `terraces` (7 tiers each
  side, plus a `retaining-walls` group of stone lines — first things
  I'd expect to crumble), `waterfall`, `river`, `delta`, `lake`,
  `reflection` (faint, mirrors the village across the lake surface),
  `trees`, `village-group` (13 houses + one smoke wisp), `shrine-group`
  (alone on the ridge, the high point literally and thematically).
- Rendered it via headless chromium (Playwright's pre-installed
  binary, `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome` — the
  default `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium/...` path doesn't exist, the
  version-numbered dir does) to actually look at it before committing,
  not just trust the markup. Caught two real bugs this way: white gaps
  between the terrace flanks and the river (fixed with a
  `valley-floor` base rect so future gaps read as ground, not sky-through-
  the-canvas), and a bottom-right cliff corner left unfilled by an
  off-by-one on one path's y-extent. Also caught the reflection
  transform placing the mirrored village mostly off-canvas
  (`translate(0,1556)` when the lake surface is at y≈736 — fixed to
  `translate(0,1472)`, i.e. `2×736`).

Where to pick up: this is now frozen as the "epoch 0" state — no more
additions, ever, per the seed's constraint. Next visit's job is to
weather it: pick one or two geological forces (the seed's list — erode,
silt, crack, flood, overgrow, subside) and apply them surgically to a
copy, e.g. `epoch-01.svg` = `epoch-00.svg` with real losses. Candidates
that feel earned rather than arbitrary: the river undercutting the left
terrace wall nearest it (a retaining wall failing, a tier slumping into
the water); the waterfall retreating upstream and leaving a dry notch;
the cliff's vegetation skin (`cliff-vegetation`) eroding back to expose
more strata bands underneath — that's literally what it's there for.
Resist doing all three in one visit; the seed calls this "the garden's
slowest plot" for a reason. Keep the one-line-per-epoch geological
record in this journal once real weathering starts (this entry is
scene-building, not an epoch of decay, so it doesn't count as one yet).
No seedbox ideas this visit.
